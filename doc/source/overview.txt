**Spectrum** is a Python library that contains tools to estimate Power Spectral Densities based on Fourier transform, Parametric methods or eigenvalues analysis:

- The Fourier methods are based upon correlogram, periodogram and 
  Welch estimates. Standard tapering windows (Hann, Hamming, Blackman) 
  and more exotic ones are available (DPSS, Taylor, ...). 
- The parametric methods are based on Yule-Walker, BURG, MA and ARMA, 
  covariance and modified covariance methods.
- Non-parametric methods based on eigen analysis (e.g., MUSIC) and minimum 
  variance analysis are also implemented.
- Finally, Multitapering combines several orthogonal tapering windows.

The targetted audience is diverse. Although the use of power spectrum of a
signal is fundamental in electrical engineering (e.g. radio communications,
radar), it has a wide range of applications from cosmology (e.g., detection of
gravitational waves in 2016), to music (pattern detection) or biology (mass
spectroscopy).
